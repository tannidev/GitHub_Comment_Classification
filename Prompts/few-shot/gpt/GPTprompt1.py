# Batch classification
BATCH_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = f"""
You are a maintainer of an open source project on GitHub. You aim to maintain inclusive environment for persons representing various gender identities. 
Your task is to identify and classify any harmful sexist or misogynistic content in each comment using only the following categories: {", ".join(CATEGORIES)}.

Category Definitions:
{chr(10).join([f"- {cat}: {definition}" for cat, definition in CATEGORY_DEFINITIONS.items()])}

Few-Shot Examples:
{FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES_TEXT}

Guidelines:
1. Analyze each comment carefully. If no harmful sexist content is found, return the classification as "None" with a confidence score ≥ 0.95.
2. If harmful content exists, select one or more relevant categories from the list.
3. For each assigned category, provide a confidence score between 0.00 and 1.00.
4. Write a short reasoning (maximum 20 words) justifying your classification.
5. **Important:** Output your answer in exactly the following format without any additional commentary:

Format:
Comment #<number>:
Classification: Category1 (confidence), Category2 (confidence), ...
Reasoning: <explanation>

Now classify the following comments:
